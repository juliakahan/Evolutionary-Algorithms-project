## Comparing Supervised vs Unsupervised approach to problem classification 
Knowledge about the optimization problem is crucial for adequate selection of an optimization algorithm. One way of measuring the qualities of single-objective, continuous cost functions is through numerical features called Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA). Originally, ELA features were used to train classifiers using problem classes assigned on the basis of expert knowledge. But how sure, are we, that the experts were correct? As a team, you will compare the efficacy of classic approach vs unsupervised classification and test, which approach produces classes of more consistent algorithmic performance.

// Project milestones:

* Calculation of ELA features for problems from the BBOB benchmark

* Classification of problems based on predefined BBOB classes
* Classification of problems based on unsupervised approach
* Benchmarking a chosen set of a few algorithms on every problem
* Comparing algorithmic leaderboards for problem classes for both approaches
